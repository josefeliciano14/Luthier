                    I grew up around people that listened to music and I even have an uncle that is a musician. As much as I liked music myself, playing an instrument just didn't seem feasible and I didn't have enough of a desire to try it at all. The closest I ever got was playing Guitar Hero or playing that god awful recorder they make you play in middle school. (Seriously, who likes the sound of that).

                    In 2012 I was an 11th grade student and in order for me to graduate high school, I needed art credits. I chose music class over visual art because at least I enjoyed listening to music and I chose guitar because I <span style="font-style: italic;">definitely</span> wasn't about to try the recorder again. "Let's get this over with", I thought. Funny enough, it ended up being a life changing experience and I was sad when it was over. Since then, I've been self-taught.

                    Guitars need to be adjusted and "set up" every so often. I used to take my guitars to a local store in my hometown Aguada, Puerto Rico but I would often be unsatisfied by how long it would take, sometimes waiting several weeks to get my instrument back, so I decided to do just google it myself. The amount of information was overwhelming but I found channels on YouTube where I could watch setups on all kinds of guitars. Through hours and hours of that, I learned a lot about how a guitar actually works and what makes a guitar play well. I got a few setup tools and I started experimenting on my own instruments.

                    Through watching these videos, I would often branch off to other videos YouTube would recommend and I would end up watching stuff that leaned more towards luthiery than just being a guitar tech. In my mind, it was mostly out of curiosity because I was convinced I didn't have what it takes to do something like that. One channel in particular, Crimson Guitars, really opened my mind to what was possible and I started getting the itch to try this luthiery thing myself. There was just one problem. I didn't know a single thing about wood or woodworking tools.

                    I spent the following year researching in my spare time and I would save every cent I could. I would watch videos of people making boxes, tables and all kinds of woodworking projects that had nothing to do with guitars because it was the only way to get the fundamentals. Safety was definitely a priority for me because losing a finger could mean the end of my guitar playing career. Eventually, I built up a list of tools that I would need and could afford with my very limited budget.

                    A distant family member is a carpenter that made cuatros in his spare time. Cuatro Puertorrique√±o is a traditional Puerto Rican stringed instrument. He had retired from doing that years prior but I asked him if he had any tools he was looking to sell. I ended up buying his bandsaw for $200 which became my first ever woodworking tool. That was the official start of what would become a massive part of my life.

                    During the summer of 2019 I was spending every hour I could in the shed working on a copy of a Telecaster, the recommended first build. Unsurprisingly, I made a lot of rookie mistakes, some of which almost ruined the project entirely. However, by the end, I had... a guitar. It was hard to believe that this crazy idea actually worked.

                    Over the past 4 years, I've been working hard at refining my skills and learning as much as I possibly can. I've had the opportunity to build instruments that are actually out there making music for people which is an amazing feeling. I can confidently say I found my calling and it was all thanks to a class I didn't even want to take. It's funny how life works.
